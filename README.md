unscramblr
=========


Just a little program I wrote while watching my mom play a word unscrambling game.

I designed my own hashing algorithm for the words so that all words which contain the same letters and letter count will recieve an identical hash.
This makes looking up unscrambled words extremely fast, as any permutation will lead me to the correct entry in the map.
